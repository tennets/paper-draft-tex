\section{Materials and Methods \label{sec:materials-and-methods}}
    \(\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^3\) is a three-dimensional vector, while \(\mat{Y}\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times 6}\) is a three-by-six matrix. 
    The \emph{mass-energy} equation reads
    
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:mass-energy-equivalence}
	    E = m c^2
    \end{equation}

    \refeq{eq:mass-energy-equivalence} is very famous.
